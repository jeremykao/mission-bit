									      <p class="content">Education has always been an interesting subject to me. I've spent about 60% of my life in school, so my time in school has likely shaped a big part of who I am today. Having gone to school in California for my entire life (K-12, College), I was pleasantly surprised at how different my education was from folks in different states.</p>
									            <p class="content">So that got me reflecting on my own background. How does my schooling compare to that of other schools in the state? How has my school changed in the past 10 years? What are some areas in which my school doeand what are some aspects in which it could improve? In this exercise, we'll answer some of those questions, wrning about various data sources and practicing our Chart.js/data visualization skills.</p>
										          <p class="content">Feel free to use some of this as a template for your upcoming final project!</p>
